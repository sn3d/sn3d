## ðŸš€ Hi, I'm Zdenko Vrabel, an engineer from Slovakia.

I'm ordinary engineer who is constantly jumping between **code** and **infrastructures**. 
I like to be in both boots - SWE and SRE. Most of my life I spent as programmer - with touching the code. 
But also I was always very close to cloud and on-prem infrastructures, Kubernetes and containers. After years 
of **C/C++** and **Java** I jumped into **Go** lang bandwagon. And I'm more 
than happy with this language.

I have passion for container internals, for Kubernetes and networking of 
containers. In my spare time, I'm **blogging** on (https://okontajneroch.sk) 
and speaking about containers on meetups for our local tech community in Kosice. 
Also I'm spamming technical content on LinkedIn, and trying to make LI more 
interesting place for tech people.

I'm big believer in **platform as a product** idea as next step in DevOps 
evolution. I believe we need more product thinking in infrastructure platform
domain. This leads me to self-study of a product design. Yes, I'm big fan of
Marty Cagan.
