Hey, I'm Zdenko. I'm just an engineer who is constantly jumping between infrastructures and code. I don't know if I'm SWE or SRE, but I like computers for sure :) I'm currently working for [kiwi.com](https://kiwi.com) as an infrastructure engineer. In my spare time, I'm blogging for our local tech community in Kosice.
