Hey, I'm Zdenko. I'm just an engineer who is constantly jumping between infrastructures and code. I like to be in both boots - SWE and SRE. But what I like most? It's building small CLI tools for other engineers.

I have passion for containers internals.

In my spare time, I'm [blogging] (okontajneroch.sk) and speaking about containers on meetups for our local tech community in Kosice.
